Team Nochba - Neighborhood Help App

Statistics show that the younger generation is largely unfamiliar with the people who live next door. Language and cultural differences also contribute to the formation of isolated groups. In the Linz that Team Nochba would like to see in the future, cohesion and neighborly help between citizens is a priority. People are part of a community in which they help each other, celebrate together and look out for each other.

And this is where Nochba comes into play. An app is to be developed that brings the neighborhood together and strengthens neighborhood help. The app is intended to support the formation of active, cohesive communities in Linz neighborhoods, large apartment buildings or apartment blocks. People within these communities should be able to ask for support of any kind. This support includes, for example, shopping for an elderly person next door, helping with renovations, or borrowing a drill. This exchange can and should encourage more sustainable living by sharing machines and establishing a repair culture.
